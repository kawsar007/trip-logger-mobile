Trip Logger is a cross-platform mobile application built with React Native (Expo) and TypeScript that allows users to record daily trips, track mileage and travel time, and generate exportable reports.

The app supports offline-first data storage using SQLite, enables multiple trip entries per day, automatically calculates total mileage and time, and allows exporting trip data as PDF or Word documents.

Designed with a clean and professional UI, the application runs seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
